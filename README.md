# GBV_prediction

Zindi AFD Solutions for Gender-based Violence Challenge -the idea is about detecting violence using computer vision and deep learning: In fact, at fisrt we scraped images of women-victims of violence- and unviolenced women, then labelised the hurted part of the face with bounding box on each image.

the notebook named Gender_Based_Violence_zindi_mentorship_program contain the code used for scrapping the images and annotating it
notebook named GBV_violence_predictions is about training faster rcnn backboned with resnet50(pytorch) to detect violence on woman's face
